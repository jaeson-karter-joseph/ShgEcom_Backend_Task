# .NET Core Clean Architecture

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to implement **Clean Architecture** in a **.NET Core** application. Clean Architecture promotes separation of concerns and emphasizes maintainability, testability, and flexibility. By dividing the application into distinct layers, it provides a foundation for building scalable and manageable solutions.

The solution structure follows the principles of Clean Architecture, where each layer has a clear responsibility and communicates with adjacent layers in a controlled and decoupled manner.

## Project Structure

The solution is organized into the following layers:

### 1. **API Layer (Presentation)**
   - **Purpose**: Exposes HTTP endpoints for external consumers (e.g., clients, front-end, third-party systems).
   - **Responsibilities**: Handles incoming requests, delegates processing to the Application layer, and returns responses.
   - **Technologies Used**: ASP.NET Core MVC or Web API.

### 2. **Application Layer**
   - **Purpose**: Contains the business use cases of the application. This layer orchestrates domain logic and handles application-specific concerns.
   - **Responsibilities**: Defines the application’s services, use cases, and interact with the Domain layer.
   - **Technologies Used**: Application Services, DTOs, and Interfaces.

### 3. **Domain Layer**
   - **Purpose**: Represents the core business logic of the application. It is independent of any external libraries or frameworks and should not depend on any other layer.
   - **Responsibilities**: Contains entities, value objects, aggregates, and business rules.
   - **Technologies Used**: Plain C# classes (Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Services).

### 4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - **Purpose**: Provides implementations for external dependencies such as databases, file systems, and third-party services.
   - **Responsibilities**: Implements interfaces from the Application layer and handles data persistence, messaging, and integration with external services.
   - **Technologies Used**: Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, APIs, File Systems, External Integrations.

## Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer is independent and has a distinct responsibility, ensuring that changes in one layer don’t affect others.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to easily scale with additional features and services.
- **Testability**: The project structure promotes unit testing and mockable dependencies, ensuring easy testability of individual components.
- **Extensibility**: New layers or features can be added without affecting existing functionality, as long as they adhere to the architecture's principles.
